                   <p>In the frenetic symphony of our modern lives, it's easy to lose ourselves in the relentless crescendo of tasks, obligations, and distractions. We become instruments playing an unfamiliar tune, the melody of our own lives fading into the background noise. It's in these moments that platforms like Three Friends offer a sanctuary, a sacred space to pause, reflect, and rediscover the harmony within.</p>
                   <p>
                    Three Friends isn't just another social media platform; it's a movement, a philosophy woven into the very fabric of its being. It champions the notion that true value lies not in the frantic pursuit of external validation, but in the quiet cultivation of inner peace and meaningful connections. At its core, it emphasizes three pillars: companioning, retreats, and friendships.</p>

                        <p>Studies show that at least 1/3 of our lives are spent at work. Writer Annie Dillard famously said, “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” For many of us, a large portion of our days is spent at work; in fact, the average person will spend 90,000 hours at work over a lifetime. It’s safe to say your job can make a huge impact on your quality of life. “We spend a lot of time at work and it really affects people’s general happiness, and also life outcomes.”</p>
                        <p>Given this emphasis, we believed that our work is a place where we can enhance the experience of living. And not just going through the motions of doing tasks, checklists, deadlines and submissions, client satisfaction, etc.  And enhancing this experience does not just mean having a good time with workmates, being okay with your boss, and getting the promotion you’ve always wanted but also having the:

                <h3>Rani Camille Baldovino</h3>
                <h4>Spiritual Director (In-Training), Pharmacist, Web Developer</h4>
                <p>Rani spent more than 10 years in the ministry of psycho-spiritual inner healing and has done retreat facilitation and spiritual accompaniment for people from different walks of life. Currently, she’s a group facilitator in COR for women who wish to engage in companioning ministry.</p>
                <p>Today she's a Spiritual Director (in training) with the CenterQuest-Asia School of Spiritual Direction. She's a millennial monk who's definition of having a good time means having regular rhythms of solitude, silence, and rest where her commitment to contemplative living is fostered. Her top values are honesty, authenticity, vulnerability, and becoming a life-long seeker. Most days, Rani spends her time watching K-drama on Netflix,   travelling, cooking a meal for herself and her husband, or going on a date with him, contemplating life’s mysteries, and attending programs dedicated to deep inner work that can expand her understanding of what she’s seeking.</p>
                <p>Professionally, she’s a registered pharmacist but currently on a sabbatical to give time for herself to rest. In the near future, she also plans to venture in the tech industry as a Web and App Developer</p>
